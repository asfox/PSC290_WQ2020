<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I am not a Python evangelist. That said, I do use python in my own work. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I first learned to code in C, then later in C++ and Java. These languages have too much overhead and are not well suited to data-manipulation programing. For a number of years I used Matlab, but I found it to be great for some things (e.g. matrix math), but terrible for others (e.g. string processing). In the end, Matlab lacked some generality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I use Python because:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Python is free, and open-source</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Other people use it (most questions can be googled)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It does a number of different things well (works with CSVs, matrices, strings, etc.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It tends to be easy to read, and generally follows the rules of a "good" language.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It works well with other tools (easily load xlsx, csv, .nii, fasta, etc.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There are a number of useful packages (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Scikit-image, etc.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In general, these are not things that are specific to Python. In many ways, I think R is also a good language. The main reasons I don't use R are: 1) There are too many ways to do the same thing to be able to read someone else's code, 2) when I made my choice, R was super slow with matrices (though, I've heard this has gotten better), and 3) it can be difficult to transition from R-code to a standalone or web-based program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Python also has some style guidelines that I like. You can get an idea of what those are by typing "<i>import this"</i> into the python prompt, which returns: </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the end, I chose Python for this class, but I encourage you to focus your learning less on the language, syntax can always be googled, and more on the structure, organization, and becoming someone who knows what questions to ask. </span></p>
