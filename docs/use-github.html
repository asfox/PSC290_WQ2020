<h2>So, you want to collaborate or share your code with the world? </h2>
<p>A big part of being a responsible scientific citizen is to make the methods that you use available to scrutiny and future use. It used to be that including a "method" section in your manuscript was the best way to do that. I don't believe this is true for most things done with modern computational frameworks. In principle, any code you used to complete your studies should be available to interested researchers. </p>
<p>To this end, I recommend sharing your code on <a href="https://github.com"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>. In addition to making your code available to other people for scrutiny, GitHub also enables shared code collaboration. (I even know people who use it for co-writing manuscripts.)</p>
<p>I recommend that you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by creating an account, here. </li>
<li>Then, you follow through this "Hello world" walkthrough. </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Once you get through the basics, you should be ready to share code with each other and with the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you want to take the next step, there are additional <a href="https://guides.github.com">GitHub guides</a>, including how to host your own personal web-page (<a href="https://asfox.github.io">like I do</a>). You can also use the <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">command line to interface with your git</a>, which is generally how I go about it. </p>
<p>Github is already the norm for people developing open-source software, and is becoming more and more common with researchers who write their own code. In the scientific literature, it has been argued that "t<span>o enable and ensure the replicability and traceability of scientific claims, it is essential that the scientific publication, the corresponding datasets, and the data analysis are made publicly available," and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4945047/">that GitHub is the solution</a>. </span> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>P.S. Github has an <a class="external" title="" href="https://education.github.com/" target="_blank"><span><span>educational discount</span></span></a> that gives you free private repositories.</p>
