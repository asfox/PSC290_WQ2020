<p>Part of the reason we <a title="Organize your projects!" href="%24WIKI_REFERENCE%24/pages/organize-your-projects" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/api/v1/courses/231220/pages/organize-your-projects" data-api-returntype="Page">organize our code</a> is so that we can re-use it.  </p>

<h4>Here are some must reads!</h4>
<p>Here is a little writeup on how to best use functions for reusability, from UCD's own Titus Brown (he works in the UC Davis genome center). I'd like you to read the sections "<a href="http://intermediate-and-advanced-software-carpentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/structuring-python.html#programming-for-reusability">Programming for Usability</a>" and the section immediately after it, "<a href="http://intermediate-and-advanced-software-carpentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/structuring-python.html#modules-and-scripts">Modules and Scripts</a>".</p>
<p>Titus also discusses <strong>testing</strong> in software. Testing is super useful. In fact, some people believe that this is the most important aspect that is missing from an academic coding education. I'm not going to force you to write tests in your code, but I am going to force you to read through "An introduction to testing concepts" from: <a style="font-size: 0.875rem;" href="http://intermediate-and-advanced-software-carpentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing-python.html">http://intermediate-and-advanced-software-carpentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing-python.html</a></p>
<h4>Maybe reads!</h4>
<p>If you've still got time, I'd recommend checking out videos on how to do <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/03/03/reproducible-data-analysis-in-jupyter/">reproducible science in python</a> by Jake VanderPlas, who we saw talk about permutations/shuffling, and who wrote the python data science handbook, has a few videos on how to do <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/03/03/reproducible-data-analysis-in-jupyter/">reproducible science in python</a>. He's always interesting. :-)</p>

<h4>Resources</h4>
<p>Here are some optional readings that might help you while working on, or thinking about, your final project. </p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook">Python Data Science Handbook</a> is fantastic. It can sometimes assume a bit of knowledge about other programming languages, but it is a great reference.</li>
<li>Wes McKinney has a video tutorial on how to work with time series data in Python. <a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0unf-C-pBYE">Time Series Data Analysis with pandas</a>.</li>
<li>Examples from Wes's book on <a href="https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book">python data analysis</a>.</li>
</ul>
